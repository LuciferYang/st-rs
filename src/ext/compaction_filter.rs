//! Port of `include/rocksdb/compaction_filter.h`.
//!
//! A [`CompactionFilter`] is called during compaction for each key in the
//! input. It can drop keys, rewrite their values, or leave them unchanged.
//! Used to implement TTL, garbage collection, and custom tombstoning —
//! which is exactly how Flink state backends use ForSt: the
//! `FlinkCompactionFilter` walks state and drops entries that have expired
//! under the state TTL policy.
